sed s/'[^0-9]'//g input | awk -F '' '{s+=$1$NF} END {print s}'

# sed just finds every non-digit and replaces it with nothing

# awk breakdown:
#
# -F '' says that the delimeter is an empty string:
# every character is a column.
#
# '{print $1$NF}' prints each first column ($1) and last column ($NF),
# which I used for debugging.
#
# '{s+=$1$NF} END {print s}' sums each of those lines and prints the result.
